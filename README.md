# Semantic Segmentation Pytorch

## Semantic Segmentation
Basically, segmentation is a process that partitions an image into regions. It is an image processing approach that allows us to separate objects and textures in images. Segmentation is especially preferred in applications such as remote sensing or tumor detection in biomedicine.
The goal of semantic image segmentation is to label each pixel of an image with a corresponding class of what is being represented. Because weâ€™re predicting for every pixel in the image, this task is commonly referred to as dense prediction.
Note that unlike the classifcation tasks, the expected output in semantic segmentation are not just labels and bounding box parameters. The output itself is a high resolution image (typically of the same size as input image) in which each pixel is classified to a particular class. Thus it is a pixel level image classification.

## Guide to use
  - Download the files
  - Open Config.py and adjust it according to your setup and adjust related file paths in it.
  - To modify training loss and optimizer open train.py and edit it.
  - To start training run train.py
  - To test your model or get predictions of unseen data run test.py and predict.py
